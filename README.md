# Sign-Language-Recognizer
In this code, a multi-class model is developed for recognizing sign language images using TensoFlow. The images are from the sign language dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist/home) which are distributed among 24 classes. The developed model consists of four convolutional and two dense layers. The callbacks class is also defined to stop training after reaching to a desired accuracy. To reduce the overfitting issue, image augmentatioin is employed in the training process. The model delivers 92% of training accuracy for augmented training set after 24 epochs (92% is set in the callbacks and it can be changed), and close to 97% testing accuracy.The acuuracy and loss changes versus epochs for both training and validtion sets are plotted at the end.
